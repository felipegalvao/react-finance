# React Finance App (without Redux)

Simple Finance Manager app built with React

This is React app to manage expenses and incomes. You need to login with Google
or Github to use it. When logged in, you can add items (expenses or incomes),
filter items by date or text and clear the filters. You can also delete
expenses and incomes. Authentication and persistence of expenses and incomes
is handle with Firebase. Tests with Karma and Expect.

You can try it out in here: https://felipegalvao.github.io/react-finance/public/index.html

Now, I'm going to rewrite it with Redux.

The new repo URL is: https://github.com/felipegalvao/react-finance-redux
